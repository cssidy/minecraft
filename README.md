# Minecraft Hacking w/ Python & Pi

What's the best way to learn Python and play video games at the same time? Raspberry Pi! The aim of this code is to demonstrate basic syntax and calls to the Minecraft API and how to build inspiring structures in your own Minecraft world.

## Code Example

The code in this repository is Python 3.5. However, there are other languages that are compatible with Minecraft: Pi Edition including:

1. Java
2. [Node.js](https://npmjs.org/package/minecraft-pi)
3. [Smalltalk](http://croquetweak.blogspot.ca/2013/02/smalltalk-bindings-for-minecraft-pi.html)
4. [Ruby](https://github.com/nhajratw/minecraft_api)
5. [Haskell](https://github.com/DougBurke/hmcpi)

## Prerequisites

To experiment with these programs, you will need to have a compatible version of Python 3 (Python 3.5 is used here) and Minecraft: Pi Edition installed on your system. You will also need an IDE. It does not have to be complex; the Python IDLE console is suitable for interacting with the game. If you are using the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, you're all set.

## Installation And Usage

### Check Software Versions

Make sure you have all prerequisites installed:

 ``` 
 python3 --version
 git --version
 ```
 

### Download GitHub Repository

In the command line, navigate to the directory that you desire to hold the source code. Then recreate the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/cssidy/minecraft-hacks
```
